Overview
In this workshop, we will be taking some data (name, age, occupation) about a group of users on our platform, a "Freelancers Forum." The data is included at the top of the index.js in the source file.Links to an external site.

Please use what you have learned so far to render data from your index.js on your index.html with as little HTML as possible. 

Project Requirements
Create files index.html
              Optional: If your instructor directed you to implement test driven development, create a index.test.js.

Clone the starter repositoryLinks to an external site. and navigate to the directory.
In the starter repository, an index.js file should already be present with an array of "users" including name, age, and occupation.
In your index.html, create a full HTML document with a single div with an ID of "root".
Inside your main() function, grab the "root" element, add an h1 element, give it text of "FREELANCERS", and append the HTML document.
Continue working inside your main() function to create an unordered list element.
Loop through the users array creating li elements. 
Append those elements to your HTML document.
Style your site using CSS.
